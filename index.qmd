I am a PhD Student at the Faculty of Information. My research looks at the application of data curation to address concerns of fairness, accountability, and transparency of datasets used for predictive modelling. I am also interested in research areas related to decision support for climate change governance. 

Some examples of  my work include: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eshta-bhardwaj/)
